Course based on 'Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach' by Peter Norvig and Stuart J. Russell

No skeleton was provided in the course - all code in the files written by me (unless specified otherwise)
Students were given the pseudocode for the algorithm but were required to design solutions to the problems themselves,
while adhering to time constraints.

Algorithms implemented in projects;
8 Puzzle Solver - DFS, BFS, A STAR
2048 Game Playing Agent - Minimax Decision
Sudoku Solver - Arc consistency, Backtrack search
Machine Learning - Perceptrons, Linear regression, Classification with sklearn
