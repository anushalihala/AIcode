%function dataset3Params()
%function [C, sigma] = dataset3Params(X, y, Xval, yval)
%EX6PARAMS returns your choice of C and sigma for Part 3 of the exercise
%where you select the optimal (C, sigma) learning parameters to use for SVM
%with RBF kernel
%   [C, sigma] = EX6PARAMS(X, y, Xval, yval) returns your choice of C and 
%   sigma. You should complete this function to return the optimal C and 
%   sigma based on a cross-validation set.
%

% You need to return the following variables correctly.
%C = 1;
%sigma = 0.3;
tryvals=[0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 1 3 10 30]

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Fill in this function to return the optimal C and sigma
%               learning parameters found using the cross validation set.
%               You can use svmPredict to predict the labels on the cross
%               validation set. For example, 
%                   predictions = svmPredict(model, Xval);
%               will return the predictions on the cross validation set.
%
%  Note: You can compute the prediction error using 
%        mean(double(predictions ~= yval))

%% =============== Part 6: Visualizing Dataset 3 ================
%  The following code will load the next dataset into your environment and 
%  plot the data. 
%

fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

% Load from ex6data3: 
% You will have X, y in your environment
load('ex6data3.mat');

% Plot training data
plotData(X, y);

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;

%% ========== Part 7: Training SVM with RBF Kernel (Dataset 3) ==========

for i=1:8
for j=1:8
   sigma=0.1 %tryvals(i)
   C=tryvals(j)

%  This is a different dataset that you can use to experiment with. Try
%  different values of C and sigma here.
% 

% Load from ex6data3: 
% You will have X, y in your environment
load('ex6data3.mat');

% Try different SVM Parameters here
%[C, sigma] = dataset3Params(X, y, Xval, yval);

% Train the SVM
model= svmTrain(X, y, C, @(x1, x2) gaussianKernel(x1, x2, sigma));
